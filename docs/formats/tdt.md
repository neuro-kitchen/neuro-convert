# TDT (Tucker-Davis Technologies)

Reader: `crates/readers/tdt` (`nc-tdt`). Reference implementations: TDT `tdt` Python package (`TDTbin2py.py`),
neo `tdtrawio.py`.

## Block files
| File | Role | Module |
|---|---|---|
| `.tsq` | 40-byte event index (authoritative list of what was recorded) | `tsq.rs` |
| `.tev` | packet data for streams and snips | `streams.rs`, `snips.rs` |
| `.sev` | one file per channel (RS4 / Synapse "discrete files"), hour splits `-<n>h`; header v0–v3 | `sev/` |
| `*_log.txt` | SEV start sample and gaps (reported as warnings) | `sev/log.rs` |
| `sort/<id>/<store>.SortResult` | offline sort codes for snips (`--sort <id>`) | `sort.rs` |
| `.Tbk` | cp437 store settings; can list stores that never recorded | `tbk.rs` |
| `.tnt` | OpenEx notes (`NOTEFILE_VERSION[x]`) | `notes/openex.rs` |
| `Notes.txt` | Synapse notes (Experiment, Subject, User, Start, Stop, runtime notes) | `notes/synapse.rs` |
| `StoresListing.txt` | Synapse store descriptions + hardware objects | `notes/synapse.rs` |
| `.tin` | Synapse run archive (zip; `Summary.txt` has start time and build) | `notes/tin.rs` |
| `.Tdx` | index acceleration, unused | — |
| `*.csv` | Synapse impedance exports (`-1` = not measured) | `impedance.rs` |

## TSQ record
`size i32 (32-bit words incl. header) · evtype i32 · name [u8;4] · chan u16 · sortcode u16 ·
timestamp f64 (Unix s) · offset/value u64 · format i32 · frequency f32`

- Record 0: file header (`size` = file size). Start marker: evtype `0x8801`, name = code 1.
  Stop marker (code 2): the **last** record; missing when a block did not end cleanly.
- Streams (`0x8101`, `& 0xFF0F`): packets of `(size - 10) * 4` bytes per channel.
- Epoc onsets (`0x101`, marks `0x8801`): value in the offset field as f64.
- Epoc offsets (`0x102`): separate store named like the onset with `\`; its chan + sortcode hold
  the onset store's 4-byte name.
- Scalars (`0x201`): one record per channel sharing a timestamp; value as f64.
- Data formats: 0 f32, 1 i32, 2 i16, 3 i8, 4 f64, 5 i64, 8 rawpacked (not supported).
- Times are snapped to the 195312.5 Hz device clock, as TDT's reader does.

## SEV header (40 bytes)
`u64 size · "SEV" · u8 version · [4] name · u16 channel · u16 total channels · u16 sample width ·
u16 reserved · u8 format (low 3 bits) · u8 decimate · u16 rate · padding`

| Version | Handling |
|---|---|
| 0 | empty header: float32 at 24414.0625 Hz, store and channel from the file name (warning) |
| 1, 2 | header name unreliable (OpenEx and RS4 disagreed): name from the file name |
| 3 | header name trusted |
| > 3 | rejected (TDT's reader: `file_version < 4`) |

- Sample rate `2^(rate − 12) × 25 MHz / decimate`; the Tbk `SampleFreq` wins when they differ > 1 Hz.
- SEV files are preferred over TEV packets of the same store; SEV-only stores (RS4) are added.
- Rawpacked (int32 words: single-unit = high 16 bits, LFP = low 16 bits) becomes `<store>_SU` and
  `<store>_LFP`. The header's 3-bit format field cannot encode it, so it is taken from the Tbk
  (`DataFormat=8`). Not yet verified against a real RS4 recording.

## Notes and sorts
- `Notes.txt` runtime notes (`Note-<n>: <clock> [<button>] "<text>"`) label the `Note` epoc in
  order; without a `Note` store one is built from the clock times (1 s resolution), as TDT does.
- `.SortResult`: 1024 bytes of channel flags, then one `u8` code per TSQ record counted among
  records with a non-empty name field (cross-checked with `read_block(sortname=...)`).
- A tank folder (sub-folders with a `.tsq`) opens one block: `--block <name>`, or its only block.

## Verification
`tools/python/compare tdt` compares every stream, epoc, scalar and snip store with
`tdt.read_block`; 0 mismatches on the TDT example data (5 blocks, Synapse 37761–48218) and
`15-25-33_meps` (all under `data/raw/tdt-examples/`). `crates/readers/tdt/tests/real_block.rs`
pins a few of those values in `cargo test`.
